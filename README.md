The sample code were provided in pure text.
Some formating and assumtions on code language have been made since the language was not provided.

### Assumed Languages
 - One   - VB.Net.
 - Two   - C#.
 - Three - javascript, I did not figure out which framework is used but is not neccesary for the task.


# Disclaimer

I am not experienced in VB.Net and while I have during tasks to improve the code been trying to implement the improvements in the language,
I have not been able to test it since it is a code snippet of a larger system. So there might be syntactical/logical errors, VB/VB.Net, and language versions inconsistencies.
